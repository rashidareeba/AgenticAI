# AI Agents

## Project Overview

This project implements AI agents for various tasks. It includes both **single-agent** and **multi-agent** systems, where each agent is designed to perform specific tasks or work collaboratively in a multi-agent environment.

### Single Agent

In the single-agent setup, a single AI agent works independently to solve problems or complete tasks. The agent uses pre-defined algorithms to make decisions and interact with its environment. The system focuses on the following core functionalities:

- **Task Planning**: The agent plans its actions based on the environment.
- **Decision Making**: The agent uses algorithms like reinforcement learning or rule-based decision making to act.

### Multiple Agents

In the multi-agent setup, multiple AI agents collaborate or compete to achieve goals. Each agent has specific roles, and they work together (or against each other) to perform more complex tasks. Some functionalities include:

- **Coordination**: Agents cooperate or negotiate to complete shared tasks.
- **Competition**: Agents compete for resources or goals.
- **Distributed Problem Solving**: Agents work in parallel to solve a problem faster or more efficiently.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rashidareeba/AgenticAI.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Single-Agent

To run a single agent, use the following command:

```bash
python singleagent.py
```

This will initialize the agent and allow it to perform the task defined in the script.

### Running Multiple Agents

To run multiple agents, use the following command:

```bash
python multiagents.py
```

This will initialize multiple agents and let them interact within the environment, collaborating or competing as defined in the script.
